# Resume Builder
### [resume-builder.js.org](https://resume-builder.js.org/)

**Gotta find a job!** Alright, let's make a new resume with this awesome template I found on Google, the problem is, this template might not be as awesome next month, or you might need to constantly add your new experience to the document. Gosh. Wouldn't be better to focus on adding new experiences in a raw format and let a automation process handle the layout? I agreed, and that's why Resume Builder is here.

#### You take care of the data, and we take care of the template.

> "Imagine you're an employer, and you have two resumes in front of you. One is filled wall-to-wall with text and uses four different fonts. It's also peppered with dozens of bolded, italicized, and underlined words and phrases.
   The second resume also offers a lot of information, but you can quickly scan the document because it makes good use of white space, features clear and consistent section headings, and uses bullets to make important items stand out.
   Which resume would you look at first?"

## About
[Resume Builder](https://resume-builder.js.org) is a free open-source project that allows anyone to easily maintain and build any kind of resume using Google Spreadsheets. This was develop as a personal project to help a friend who was struggling spending up to an hour to make a custom resumes. **[TRY IT NOW](https://resume-builder.js.org).**

Older versions: [V1](https://github.com/werules/home-finder/blob/main/README_V1.MD), [V2](https://github.com/werules/home-finder/blob/main/README_V2.MD) and [V3](https://github.com/werules/home-finder/blob/main/README_V3.MD).

## Features
- Multiple Resume templates (soon)
- Parse data from Google Spreadsheet URL, .xls file or .json file.
- Support Json format from [github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/tree/v1.0.0).
- Convert Google Spreadsheet data into [github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/tree/v1.0.0) format.
- Theme created with [material-ui-theme-editor](https://in-your-saas.github.io/material-ui-theme-editor/), so it's easy for you to customize.
- Cover Letter Editor

## JSON Resume Schema
This project uses the [jsonresume/resume-schema](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema) v1.0.0, but due to a need to extend some of it's features, we also added 4 new fields:
- `__translation__` to translate template keys.
- `coverLetter` to add your own Cover Letter template.
- `work[].keywords` to add keywords to your work experience.
- `enableSourceDataDownload` to allow the JSON data to be downloaded from the resume itself.

## Build your resume from scratch
Don't have a JSON or don't fill like filling up a spreadsheet? No problem! You can make your resume from scratch by filling up some fields, and then you can download it as a JSON to use it later with this app [or others](https://github.com/search?q=json-resume).

<img src="/screenshots/v4/resume_builder_form.gif?raw=true" width="890px" />

## Online viewer
Create a GitHub repo [like this one](https://github.com/blopa/resume.json) with the name `resume.json` and a file called `resume.json` in a branch called `main` and following the JSON schema from [github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/tree/v1.0.0) v1.0.0.

Then you can access your resume via https://resume-builder.js.org/view/TEMPLATE/GITHUB_USER, for example this URL: [https://resume-builder.js.org/view/default/blopa](https://resume-builder.js.org/view/default/blopa). You can also append `/lang` to the end of the URL to add a proper translation to your resume, for example [https://resume-builder.js.org/view/default/blopa/es](https://resume-builder.js.org/view/default/blopa/es).

## Cover Letter Editor
Now you can edit your own Cover Letter by using [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) bracket variables, for example:

With the text `This is a cover letter for {{company}}`, you will be able to edit the word `company` dynamically by typing another word in the variable input in the sidebar:

Check the gif below for more details

<img src="/screenshots/v4/cover_letter_editor.gif?raw=true" width="890px" />

## Available Translations
We currently have translations for **English**, **Spanish** and **Brazilian Portuguese**, those are going to be used to translate sections of your resume, like the title "Publications", etc.

Don't like the way a translation key is translated? For example, you might prefer using "Projects" instead of "Publications".

Simply add a custom `__translations__` object to your `resume.json` file with the keys you would like to translate and their new translation, for example:

```json
{
  "__translation__": {
    "publications": "Projects",
    "education": "Study"
  }
}
```

You can also add it to your spreadsheet by creating columns with the value `__translation__`, like:

Would you like to have your language added to Resume Builder? [Create a Pull Request](https://github.com/werules/home-finder/issues/18).

## Usage
First of all you need to create a Google Spreadsheet following the same rules as [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jRMEvfI6OsWUwnaHgH5UwnoikZA0a3s8wPnCortNJ_A/copy) (you can make a copy if you like) and populate with your resume information.
- **name:** Your full name
- **label:** Your resume Job Title
- **picture:** A URL for your picture
- **summary:** Summary of yourself
- **url:** Your website URL
- **email:** Your email
- **phone:** Your phone number
- **address:** Your address
- **postalCode:** Your postal code
- **city:** City where you're located
- **region:** Region where you're located
- **countryCode:** Country code where you're located
- **network:** Social media name
- **username:** Social media username
- **coverLetter:** Your cover letter template
- **__translation__:** Add your custom translations

###**Please make sure to [publish your Spreadsheet to the web](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308870)**, otherwise it won't work.
